# 📝 Sign Up Form!

This is the fifth "The Odin Project" exercise.

Project coded with just JavaScript and CSS.

The idea of this exercise is to learn form basics.

Validation is done through HTML with the require atribute.

Also adds a submit button, which, when clicked, if the info provided does not meet the requirements, returns a message showing which field needs fixing.

Here is an image preview:

The basics of the project are:
* Learning forms
* Testing form atributes
* Trying out validation through html "required"
* Submit buttons
